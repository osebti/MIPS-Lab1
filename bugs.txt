Errors:

Line 26: The load byte (lb) instruction should be used here in the place of the lw instruction. This is because 
we only intend on loading a byte and not a full word from the memory address corresponding to the label.
Loading a word might add unexpected byted to the register $a1.

Corrected Line: lb $a1, Old



Line 37: The addi instruction here adds 4 bytes to the count register (addi $a0, $a0, 4); however we 
only want to add one byte since we are looping aver characters in the string (which are each one byte).

Corrected Line: addi $a0, $a0, 1
